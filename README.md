# Rust Learning Projects

This repository contains sample projects that I have completed while learning the Rust programming language. Here you will find a range of projects from simple applications that demonstrate the basic concepts of Rust to more complex applications.

## Projects

- **hello-rust**: A simple "Hello, world!" application demonstrating the basic syntax of Rust.
- **guessing_game**: A console-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.
- **variables**: Examples of variable declarations and usage in Rust.

## Installation

To run these projects, first install Rust from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mfarsx/rust-learning-projects.git
```

Within each project folder, you can run the project using:

```sh
cargo run
```
